### 2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points.

_Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions ‚Äì something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general._

**Result**:

Certainly! In this paragraph, the key points are:

1. Pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks has led to significant improvements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
2. While current NLP systems require task-specific fine-tuning datasets with thousands of examples, humans can perform new language tasks with just a few examples or simple instructions.
3. Scaling up language models, such as GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, has shown improved task-agnostic, few-shot performance without the need for fine-tuning or gradient updates.
4. GPT-3 demonstrates strong performance on various NLP tasks like translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as tasks requiring on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation.
5. However, GPT-3 still struggles with some few-shot learning tasks and faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.
6. GPT-3 can generate news articles that are difficult for human evaluators to distinguish from those written by humans, raising discussions about broader societal impacts.

In summary, the paragraph discusses the advancements in NLP through pre-training and fine-tuning, the capabilities and limitations of GPT-3 in few-shot learning, and its potential societal impacts.

### 3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

_Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a small robot named Spark. Spark was designed to help with household chores, but deep down, he longed for something more - friendship._

_One day, while wandering through the city's park, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten garden filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds. As he explored the garden, he noticed a lonely scarecrow standing in a corner, looking forlorn._

_Spark approached the scarecrow and struck up a conversation. To his surprise, the scarecrow responded with a warm smile and a kind voice. They quickly became friends, sharing stories and laughter under the bright sun._

_From that day on, Spark and the scarecrow spent every day together, enjoying the simple joys of friendship in the most unexpected of places._

### 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

_Hello! That's a great question. Let's break it down step by step to figure out how many packs of each you need to buy._

_First, let's start with the apples. Since each pack contains 4 apples, to get 12 apples, you would need 12 divided by 4, which equals 3 packs of apples._

_Next, let's move on to the oranges. Each pack contains 3 oranges, and you want to get 9 oranges. So, you would need 9 divided by 3, which equals 3 packs of oranges._

_Therefore, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions._

### 3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

_Once upon a time in a bustling city, there lived a small robot named Zippy. Zippy was designed to clean the streets, but he often felt lonely as he whirred along, picking up litter. One rainy afternoon, while tidying up a park, Zippy noticed a tiny, shivering bird trapped under a fallen branch._

_With a gentle whir, he lifted the branch, freeing the little creature. The bird, grateful and chirpy, fluffed its feathers and perched on Zippy‚Äôs shoulder. They shared stories‚ÄîZippy spoke of his adventures in the city, while the bird sang of the skies and distant lands._

_From that day on, they explored together, Zippy cleaning the streets while the bird flew above, guiding him to hidden treasures and secret spots. In the heart of the city, amidst the hustle and bustle, Zippy found a true friend in the most unexpected place, proving that friendship can blossom anywhere._

### 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

Of course! Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of packs of apples needed**:

- The store sells apples in packs of 4.
- To find out how many packs you need for 12 apples, you can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
  \[
  \text{Number of packs of apples} = \frac{12 \text{ apples}}{4 \text{ apples per pack}} = 3 \text{ packs}
  \]

2. **Determine the number of packs of oranges needed**:

- The store sells oranges in packs of 3.
- To find out how many packs you need for 9 oranges, you can divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per pack:
  \[
  \text{Number of packs of oranges} = \frac{9 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges per pack}} = 3 \text{ packs}
  \]

3. **Summary**:

- You need to buy **3 packs of apples** and **3 packs of oranges** to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

"Vibe checking" refers to an informal and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems, which poses challenges for scalability, consistency, and progress tracking. As these systems grow, manual testing becomes increasingly slow and time-consuming. Additionally, inconsistent test coverage may lead to inaccurate assessments of the system's status. Finally, vibe checking lacks a reliable baseline for measuring the impact of future changes.
